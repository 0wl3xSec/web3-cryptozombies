# ðŸ§Ÿ CryptoZombies Journey

Learning Solidity through CryptoZombies.

This repo tracks my progress, notes, experiments, and mini-projects as I build smart contracts.


## ðŸ§  What I'm Doing

- Completing each CryptoZombies lesson
- Writing clean Solidity code for each chapter
- Annotating lessons with personal notes
- Trying side-quests like modifying or extending functionality
